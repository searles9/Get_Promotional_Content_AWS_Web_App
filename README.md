# App architecture
* User goes to a website hosted in S3
* User enters email into the text field and hits submit
* The submit button contacts an AWS API
* API triggers a lambda function
* Lambda function sends the S3 object URL to the user's email via SES

***
# Steps to deploy the site:
### Step 1: Add your email to SES
The app processes the website requests with Lambda and uses SES to send the email. If you have a new AWS account

### Step 1: Deploy the infrastructure via CloudFormation
The "Resources.YAML"  (cfn\Resources.yaml) file deploys the following resources:
* An S3 bucket that is enabled for website hosting
* An S3 bucket with public read access that will contain the promotional content file
* An HTTP API (including a route, stage, integration settings and deployment)
* A Lambda function that processes the requests and sends the email
* A Lambda execution role
